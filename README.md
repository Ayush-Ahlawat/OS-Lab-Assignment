Setup Instructions
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system
Git installed (optional, if cloning the repo)
Optional: VS Code for easy execution and viewing of files


Assignment 1: Process Creation and Management
File: process_management.py
Output: output.txt
Steps to Run
Windows

cd OS_assignment1 python process_management.py

Linux

cd OS_assignment1 python3 process_management.py

The program executes all tasks, including process creation, command execution, simulated zombie/orphan processes, and process info inspection. Output is saved in output.txt.

Tasks Covered
Process creation using Python's multiprocessing

Execute system commands using subprocess

Simulated zombie and orphan processes

Inspect current process info

Simulated process prioritization

Assignment 2: System Startup Simulation
File: system_startup.py
Output: process_log.txt
Steps to Run
Windows:

cd OS_assignment2 python system_startup.py

Linux:

cd OS_assignment2 python3 system_startup.py

process_log.txt will contain timestamped logs of process execution.

Tasks Covered
Initialize logging for process events

Define dummy process tasks

Create and start multiple processes concurrently

Ensure proper termination and logging

Notes
Both scripts are cross-platform compatible.

Ensure Python is added to your system PATH.

output.txt and process_log.txt files are auto-generated by the scripts.

Use python for Windows and python3 for Linux.
